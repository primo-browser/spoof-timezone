# Timezone Spoofer

Extension which alters the browser timezone reported by JS APIS to an IP based or user-defined value.

It is a fork of [This Extension](https://github.com/joue-quroi/spoof-timezone) for which the source code is in the "old" directory.  
This fork maintains the same license, but has branding and JS changes to tailor it for inclusion in PrimoBrowser.
